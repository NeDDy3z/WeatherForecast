# Weather Forecast
- Pulling weather data from [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API
- I made this website to learn how to work with Client/Server-side caching and Cookies
- The goal was to create a site that was as optimized as possible and would load quickly *(the whole site loads in **1s** and has only **3.3KB**)*
  - The intended use of this website is for mountain climbers that often need a detailed forecast while having a very slow internet access
